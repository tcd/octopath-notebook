Boosting does seem to improve accuracy considerably, as does your aim stat, though it is believed the enemies evade does not factor in to accuracy. No matter what, will always land a minimum of 3 hits.	TRUE				TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE		TRUE

The weapon will be destroyed	35	Varies	One enemy	100	40	34	28	24	0.67			Unknown exactly how this works. Seems to be vaguely quadratic damage with the P.Atk of the weapon selected, but not quite. I have no idea what is going on with the ability ratio either, but this is how it is in game.	TRUE				TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE		TRUE	
96	Warmaster	8	Winnehild's Battle Cry		[DS] Wield six weapons to unleash six attacks on all foes	50	All 6 weapons	All enemies	140				150	0.8		12.6	Seems to add about half of each weapons P.Atk value to your P.Atk (on top of the normal amount for that weapon) when calculating damage for it. Seems to also be a bit glitchy with regards to damage when breaking and hitting weak points, sometimes damage is calculated as though enemies are not broken at all. Also seems to increase damage slightly more when calculating attacks with very weak/makeshift weapons. Finally, values are approximate. There is likely something else going on with the damage output of this skill that hasn't been discovered yet.					TRUE	TRUE				TRUE
